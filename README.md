# News Site

Assignment was to create a news site filling all the reguirements. Managed to fill all the levels. 

## The problem

I decided to try out both grid and flexbox but ran into problems so just did everything in flexbox. If i had more time i would do more on the design and estetics, play with links and buttons. 

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
